# Multi-Shock-Compression-Inlet-Simulation
This project simulates a shock-train inside a supersonic inlet using multiple oblique shocks followed by a normal shock. It computes pressure, temperature, and total-pressure variations, studies the effect of deflection angles on inlet efficiency, and models final pressure recovery using an isentropic diffuser.
